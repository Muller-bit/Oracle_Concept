Oracles Concepts
Blockchains are designed to be self-contained and deterministic systems. Deterministic means that given the same inputs, the system will always produce the same outputs. This property is crucial for security and consensus, as all blockchain nodes must agree on the state of the data for every transaction.

Blockchains process transactions with higher latency than traditional computing systems due to their need for global consensus.

Smart contracts have limited functionality because they cannot independently fetch real-world data (e.g., financial market prices, weather conditions, IoT sensor readings).

This fundamental limitation is known as the Oracle Problem. Blockchain applications struggle to achieve full real-world applicability without a reliable way to connect with external data sources.

Decentralized Oracles Network(DON)

Use multiple independent nodes to fetch and validate data, reducing risks of manipulation and downtime.

Enhance security, transparency, and reliability by distributing trust among multiple parties to create a trust-minimized system.

*Chainlink Price and Data Feeds --> Provide data on-chain, such as price information for cryptocurrencies, commodities, foreign exchange rates, etc.
                      --> Real-world use: When you use a DeFi platform that needs to know the current ETH/USD price, it's likely using Chainlink Price Feeds.


*Chainlink automation(formerly keepers) --> Allows smart contracts to be automatically triggered when certain conditions are met.
                                        --> Real-world use: Automatically liquidating collateral in lending platforms when values drop below required thresholds.

*Chainlink CCIP Message ==> Enables secure communication between different blockchains.
It Creates a way for smart contracts on one blockchain to send messages and tokens to another blockchain in a secure and decentralized way.
Real-world use: Send tokens from Ethereum to Polygon or have a smart contract on one chain trigger an action on another chain.

*Verifiable Random Function (VRF) :  Generates provably fair and verifiable random numbers that cannot be manipulated or predicted.
It Uses cryptographic techniques to create random numbers that come with proof they were generated fairly.
Real-world usecase: NFT projects use VRF to fairly distribute random traits or select winners for giveaways.

*Chainlink - Data Streams
It provide on-demand access to high-frequency, low-latency market data, delivered off-chain and verifiable on-chain.
How it works: Data streams use a pull-based design that supports sub-second data resolution for latency-sensitive use cases by retrieving data ONLY  when needed.
Real-world use: High-frequency price updates for apps like predictions markets(POLY-MARKET) that enable participants to react quickly to events and provide accurate settlements.


*Chain-link - Proof of reserve --> Proof of Reserve
It  Verifies that tokenized assets (like stablecoins) are actually backed by real-world reserves.
How it works: Regularly checks and confirms that the claimed backing assets exist in the reported amounts.
Real-world use: Stablecoin issuers can prove they have the money backing their tokens.( Circle , Teter)

DeFi (Decentralized Finance) - Borrowing and Lending protocols
Major lending and trading platforms use Chainlink to get accurate price information for cryptocurrencies and other assets.
Example: When you take out a crypto loan on Aave or trade on Uniswap, Chainlink price feeds help determine fair values and prevent exploitation.
