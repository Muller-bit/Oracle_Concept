Oracles Concepts
Blockchains are designed to be self-contained and deterministic systems. Deterministic means that given the same inputs, the system will always produce the same outputs. This property is crucial for security and consensus, as all blockchain nodes must agree on the state of the data for every transaction.

Blockchains process transactions with higher latency than traditional computing systems due to their need for global consensus.

Smart contracts have limited functionality because they cannot independently fetch real-world data (e.g., financial market prices, weather conditions, IoT sensor readings).

This fundamental limitation is known as the Oracle Problem. Blockchain applications struggle to achieve full real-world applicability without a reliable way to connect with external data sources.
